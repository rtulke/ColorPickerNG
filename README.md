# ColorPickerNG
A really simple ColorPicker that works with standard Python libraries.

I tried to write a simple but practical ColorPicker on a very limited version of Windows where Python can only be used with standard libraries. This ColorPicker still works on Linux, macOS and Windows. I had the problem that I could neither install programs on a Windows system myself (missing Windows permissions) nor had the option to simply install Python modules via Pip. Since it was too cumbersome for me to install the Python packages by hand (many dependencies).
